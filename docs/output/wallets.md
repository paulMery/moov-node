Every Moov account automatically comes with a Moov wallet, which serves as a funding source as you accumulate funds. You can also use the Moov wallet to:

- Pre-fund transfers for faster payouts
- Transfer funds between Moov wallets for instantly available funds

At this time, wallets can't be manually created, deleted or modified. They are read-only and are automatically created when a Moov account is associated with an application. For more context, read our guide on [wallets](guides/sources/wallet/).
