Payments methods represent all of the ways an account can move funds to another Moov account. Payment methods are generated programmatically when a card or bank account is added or the status is updated. For example, `ach-debit-fund` will be added as a payment method once the bank account is verified. For more context, read our guide on [payment methods](guides/money-movement/payment-methods/).
